# Certification-Management
 Certification Management System is a platform designed using Salesforce software to track and manage Salesforce Certification vouchers
 issued to all practice members.
 The application is managed by two types of users-App User and App Admin. 
 App User consolidates data provided by different Employees and creates Certification Voucher requests for each of them which are then 
 sent to the App Admin for approval.Once approved by the App Admin, an active voucher is assigned to the request automatically. 
 Hence provides the employee with a voucher which he/she can use to avail discount while applying for the respective Certification. 
 Emails are sent automatically at every stage to keep users updated about the progress. 
 Also it keeps track of the number of Certified resources in each category.
